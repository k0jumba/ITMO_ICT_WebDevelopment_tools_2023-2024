# HTTP Parser Documentation

This web server fetches random user data from an external API, processes the response, and stores the user information in the local database. The user data is then returned in a serialized JSON format.

## API Endpoints

### 1. `GET /`

- **Description**: 
  - Fetches user data from the external API `https://randomuser.me/api/`.
  - Extracts relevant fields from the response (email, first name, and last name).
  - Writes the extracted user data to the database.
  - Returns a serialized JSON object representing the stored user data.

- **Request Type**: `GET`
  
- **Response**:
  - `200 OK`: Successfully fetched the user data from the external API, saved it to the database, and returned the serialized user object.
  - The response contains the user's `id`, `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.
  
- **Example Response**:
  ```json
  {
    "id": 25,
    "email": "selena.evertsen@example.com",
    "first_name": "Selena",
    "last_name": "Evertsen"
  }
  ```

### Workflow

1. **Fetch User Data**: 
   - The server makes a request to `https://randomuser.me/api/` to retrieve random user data.
   
2. **Extract User Data**:
   - The following fields are extracted from the API response:
     - `email`: User's email address.
     - `first_name`: User's first name.
     - `last_name`: User's last name.

3. **Store in Database**:
   - The extracted user data is written to the database.
   - A unique `id` is assigned to the user record in the database.

4. **Return Serialized Data**:
   - After storing the user in the database, a JSON object containing the `id`, `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name` is returned.

## Error Handling

- **500 Internal Server Error**: Returned if there is a failure in:
  - Fetching the data from the external API.
  - Storing the user data in the database.

## External API Information

- The server relies on data from the external API `https://randomuser.me/api/`. This API provides randomly generated user data, which is then processed and stored by the web server.

## Example Workflow

1. A user sends a `GET` request to `/`.
2. The server fetches a random user from `https://randomuser.me/api/`.
3. The server extracts the necessary user data (email, first name, last name).
4. The extracted data is written to the database.
5. The server responds with a JSON object that includes the user's `id`, `email`, `first_name`, and `last_name`.
